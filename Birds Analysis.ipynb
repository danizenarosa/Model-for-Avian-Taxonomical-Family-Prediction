Through this classification investigation, we were able to use a dataset to classify individual bird observations into their respective families using mass and beak length. This study investigated the two key traits of birds to classify individuals into one of the ten largest families in the dataset to identify trends or relationships between them. By using 5-fold cross-validation and comparing those results in a confusion matrix we were able to generally classify the individuals into their respective taxonomic families. Figure 3 suggests that mass and beak length are important indicators for classifying birds and could have many implications for observational studies. However, this sample only considers 2 traits and to obtain a more reliable classifier, a more complex method must be applied which was out of the scope of this investigation. Other limitations such as differences in behavior and genetics also play a role in the classification process. The differences in beak length and mass of each reflect the differences in their habitats and ecological niches. This investigation demonstrates the differences in traits that can be acquired from residing in different ecological niches and gaining an understanding of this can have many implications for studying the different kinds of birds. Another implication of classification is its outreach into the conservation of bird species. Utilizing an effective classifier can allow conservation movements to work more efficiently to mitigate the loss in biodiversity when aiming to protect an individual bird species.
